			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>The Cyber Defense Organization’s motto is to “provide practical skills for practical situations”. We aim to teach students new skills and allow them to apply the skills they learned in class/ in the club to hands on exercises. We do this through interactive workshops, Blue (defense)/Red (attack)/Purple (mixture of both Blue and Red) Team competition attendance (including our own competition GDDC), interest groups, and a thriving discord community. For more details on this please visit the rest of the pages on the website and do not hesitate to contact us at ualbanycyberdefenseorg@gmail.com.</p>
