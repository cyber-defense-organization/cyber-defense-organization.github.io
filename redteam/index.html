		<h3>Team Info</h3>
		<p>The Cyber Defense Organization's Red Team is one of the organization's offerings which holds meetings weekly and participates in offensive security competitions that mimic real-life penetration testing scenarios. A penetration test is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. This is a large industry within cybersecurity and our members prepare to join this workforce by learning ethical hacking techniques and applying those techniques in penetration testing competitions. The group is fairly new and will be attending its first Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) this Fall.</p>
