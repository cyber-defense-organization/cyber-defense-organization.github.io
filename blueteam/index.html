		<h3>Team Info</h3>
		<p>The Blue Team focuses on defensive operations within cyber security. Our team works on securing Linux and Windows machines, monitoring network traffic for signs of malicious activity, and a whole lot more. If you are interested in scripting, network forensics, and system administration these competitions provide an arena to thrive in. They also provide opportunities for soft skills like presentation, writing, and public speaking. The best part is that there is no prior knowledge required!</p>
